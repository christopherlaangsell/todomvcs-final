# todomvcs-final
Compilation of prominent ClojureScript-React wrappers and frameworks. 

These six TodoMVCs were used and expanded for testing purposes for Christopher Gsell's master's survey paper. Each TodoMVC contains the appropriate Readme and citation documentation. Of the six TodoMVCs, the Rum one is novel and the Re-Posh one is significantly expanded. All six are fully functioning for the benchmarks performed, though many lack styling. To perform the intended benchmark suite on any of the TodoMVCs, simply start the app and click through the six benchmark buttons. Allow time for the screen to re-render, especially for benchmark five. The benchmark course is idempotent, and can be repeated as many times as needed, always returning to the state of no to-do items.
